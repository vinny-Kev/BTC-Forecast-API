# Frontend Integration Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Prediction Error: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'tail'`

**Problem:** 
The `preprocessor.transform()` method returns a numpy array, but the code was trying to call `.tail()` on it, which is a pandas DataFrame method.

**Solution:**
After scaling features with the preprocessor, convert the numpy array back to a pandas DataFrame:

```python
# Scale features
X_scaled = preprocessor.transform(X)

# Convert back to DataFrame to use .tail() method
X_scaled_df = pd.DataFrame(X_scaled, columns=feature_columns, index=X.index)

# Now we can use .tail() safely
X_regular = X_scaled_df.tail(1).values
X_lstm_seq = X_scaled_df.tail(sequence_length).values
```

### 2. Metadata Not Being Read by Frontend

**Problem:**
The `/model/info` endpoint was returning minimal information that didn't match what the frontend expected.

**Solution:**
Enhanced the `/model/info` endpoint to return comprehensive model information including:

```json
{
  "metadata": { /* full metadata object */ },
  "feature_count": 20,
  "n_features": 20,
  "sequence_length": 30,
  "model_loaded": true,
  "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
  "interval": "1m",
  "training_date": "20251006_112413",
  "performance": {
    "train_accuracy": 0.966,
    "test_accuracy": 0.891,
    "train_f1": 0.492,
    "test_f1": 0.314,
    "train_roc_auc": 0.998,
    "test_roc_auc": 0.628
  },
  "train_samples": "N/A",
  "test_samples": "N/A"
}
```

## Expected Frontend Behavior

After these fixes, the frontend should:

1. ✅ **Successfully get predictions** without the numpy array error
2. ✅ **Display model performance metrics** in the dashboard:
   - Features: 20
   - Sequence Length: 30
   - Train/Test samples (if available in metadata)
   - Train/Test accuracy, F1 scores, ROC-AUC

3. ✅ **Show model metadata**:
   - Symbol: BTCUSDT
   - Interval: 1m
   - Training date

## Testing

To test these fixes locally:

```bash
# Start the API
python prediction_api.py

# Test model info endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/model/info

# Test prediction endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symbol":"BTCUSDT","interval":"1m","use_live_data":true}'
```

## Deployment

The changes have been pushed to the main branch and will automatically deploy to Render. The deployment should:

1. Load all three models (CatBoost, Random Forest, LSTM)
2. Serve the `/health` endpoint for health checks
3. Return proper metadata from `/model/info`
4. Handle predictions without numpy array errors

## Notes

- The metadata.json file doesn't currently include `train_samples` and `test_samples` fields. These can be added during model training if needed.
- All models are loading successfully (CatBoost, Random Forest, LSTM)
- The API gracefully handles missing LSTM models by using only CatBoost and Random Forest
